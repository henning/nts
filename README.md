# J6

J6 is a **chord player** oscillator and **sequencer**.

This oscillator is inspired by the Roland J-6 synthesizer, so you can check it out to understand the concept behind this oscillator.

Each note plays a different chord, and there are 100 different chord sets. These are the same as the Roland J-6 chord sets, that can be found at: https://static.roland.com/manuals/J-6_manual_v102/eng/28645807.html

It also includes:
- Mixable waveforms: saw, pulse, pulse suboscillator (with PWM for the pulse waves)
- 100 playing patterns (rhythmic, arpeggios and mixed)
- Transpose in semitones up to + or – 4 octaves
- 16-step sequencer with variable step length, for a max of 16 bars of chord playing

# Proba-B

Proba-B is a **probability sequencer** based oscillator.

Use the built-in arpeggiator or record a step sequence, from 1 to 64 steps (default is 8 steps).
Then assign **probability** values to each step, for step **mute**, **transpose** and **shape** change.
The oscillator waveshape itself is a **triangle** waveform, with **wave folding** (shape parameter) and **frequency modulation** (alt parameter).

Works great with delay effects.

Extra features include:
- microtuning
- time division
- transpose, with auto minor to major scale converter.

# Volca Bass

The Volca Bass oscillator copies the “architecture” of the oscillator section of the **Volca Bass**.

It includes 3 oscillators, each with on/off, saw/square waveform, and pitch control up to +/-1 octave.

Includes also a **slide** function, **octave** selection (even with the ribbon), and a **step sequencer**, with 16 steps for notes or rest, and slide selection per step.

It features **3 memory slots** for sequences, and a 4th group slot, that plays all the other 3 at the same time, each to its oscillator, **paraphonically**.
